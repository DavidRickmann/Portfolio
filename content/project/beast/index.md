As part if their maintenance planning function A-one+ highways used a piece of legacy software called BEAST.
BEAST was used to develop large format diagrams of road networks but development had stalled and the organisation no longer retained the expertise to continue development.

My role on this project was to reverse engineer BEAST, fix several functional issues, develop new features and document the process.
