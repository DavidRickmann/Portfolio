The Williams Rail Review was established in September 2018 to look at the structure of the whole rail industry and the way passenger rail services are delivered. 

I developed software tools to automatically process ticketing data allowing it to be broken down across multiple axes. 

The workflow for this task was originally a longwinded process where a ticketing expert would ask a question, that would be passed to a data analyst to sift through the dataset and produce graphs and results which would then go back to the expert to look over and decide what question they needed to ask next.

With the new analytical software the ticketing expert could explore the data easily and perform their own analysis. This collapsing of thye data flow loops drastically improved the process leading to insights which may otherwise have been missed and significantly reduced analysis time and costs.
