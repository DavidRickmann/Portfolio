The West London Orbital railway is a proposed extension to the London Overground that seeks to bring sections of rail between West Hampstead and Hounslow back into active use. This includes the Dudding Hill Line, North London Line and Hounslow Loop. The route would increase connectivity in the area, connecting together The Jubilee Line, Bakerloo Line, Thameslink, Crossrail and HS2 and the Piccadilly line. 

My role on this project was as principal data scientist. I developed systems to take large scale regional demand data, clean it and recasting it in a form suitable to be represented as a GIS layer. This let us take a high level view of areas which benefit most under different design cases and determine the potential economic benefits of the new line.
