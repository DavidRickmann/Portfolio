The Horizon Innovations study was an examination of upcoming technical innovations performed for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. The aim of the study was to determine which areas of legislation the department should focus on to encourage the development of technological innovations. 

The department had developed a corpus of data about potential new technologies which may be limited by a regressive regulatory environment. 
My role as data scientist was to conducting data cleaning and sorting of the data and then to apply a natural language processing model to better understand which fields the included innovations were in, how they were distributed and which fields were most amenable to legislative intervention.
