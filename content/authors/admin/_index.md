I am a highly experienced Data Scientist with over 15 years of experience.  
I’ve worked on projects ranging from sole data analyst on single day studies to leading the modelling for successful multi-billion-pound infrastructure bids. 

I’m fluent in SQL, R, Python, Tableau, Microsoft BI, and many other technologies and have led training sessions to share that expertise with others.
