      <title>Horizon Innovations Study</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Horizon Innovations study was an examination of upcoming technical innovations performed for the Department for Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy. The aim of the study was to determine which areas of legislation the department should focus on to encourage the development of technological innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department had developed a corpus of data about potential new technologies which may be limited by a regressive regulatory environment.
My role as data scientist was to conducting data cleaning and sorting of the data and then to apply a natural language processing model to better understand which fields the included innovations were in, how they were distributed and which fields were most amenable to legislative intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Comparative Volume of Children and Pigeons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was asked to undertake this study by a neighbourhood child who wanted to know how many uncompressed pigeons would occupy the same space as a five year old child. I advised the client on the principle of &amp;ldquo;Wisdom of the Crowd&amp;rdquo; as first demonstrated by Francis Galton whereby multiple independant observations tended to converge on a more accurate answer than any of those individual observations. They then conducted a survey to determine an estimated answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client was concerned that their respondees were insufficiently motivated and / or knowledgable within the study domain and requested a more involved supplementary analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My analysis began with stating known variables (The specific characteristics of the subject child) and then a follow up desk based material review. From this review data sources for average child heights and weights was aquired along with average mass and body density data for various bird species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  General Linear Models procedure (SAS Institute. Inc. 1988) was used to determine differences in density and feather mass among species and between sexes within species. Because the use of two or more related response variables (i.e. three measurements of density) to address a single hypothesis increases the probability of committing a type I error, the Bonferroni inequality technique was employed to ensure that the type I error rate was  under .05 (Bed &amp;amp; Khamis 1991). To maintain this probability level, 0.05 was divided by the number of response variables (three) tested. resulting in significant differences at P &amp;lt; 0.017. If differences occurred. Tukey tests were used to determine which means differed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these data sources I was able to determine the average volume of a five year old child to be 34 pigeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final report was delivered to the client who reported a high level of satisfaction with the finished work. This report is available from the PDF link above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixed Forward water treatment pricing tool.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Severn Trent Water wanted to move from a flat rate chargin model to a fairer usage based model for their industrial water clients. Unfortunately water sampling is often inconsistent and may not tell the full story about a clients usage rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, one client, a brewery produced a large volume of contaminated water during one phase of the brewing process (a weekly production cycle) but on other days produced relatively little. Standard statistical analysis of sample data would show wild swings in their usage depending on if their output was sampled during the active period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to correctly set pricing my team developed a tool to perform statistical analyses on water sampling data and use this to deduce the correct pricing level in terms of suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client was interested in using an Excel front end, since they were familiar with excel, but to do most of the complicated statistical processing using R. As lead developer I oversaw the process to marry these two systems together, but also developed a web based system allowing themto move away from the cumbersome excel interface if they so chose.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HS2 Health and safety analysis.</title>
      <link>/project/hs2-h_and_s/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to reduce work related injuries the High Speed 2 project undertook an analysis of health and safety data sourced from the Crossrail project, with the assumption that two large rail projects would have similar risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I led a team of 4 analysts conducting a deep dive into all aspects of safety related incidents over the lifetime of Crossrail. We deliberately adopted a naive stance, rejecting standard assumptions of health and safety until they could be compared against the corpus of data available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst the findings we discovered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No evidence that clocks changing was a significant factor for workplace injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A limited impact of &amp;ldquo;Toolbox talks&amp;rdquo; or safety briefings with a detrimental effect at higher frequency (presumed due to complacency)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No increased injuries during snow days, but an increased injury rate approximately one week after snowy weather. Presumed to be caused by an increase in caution during the snowy weather, since the hazard it presents is evident, but a reduced level of caution once that risk and resultant risk controls are removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
