I advised the client on the principle of \u0026ldquo;Wisdom of the Crowd\u0026rdquo; as first demonstrated by Francis Galton whereby multiple independant observations tended to converge on a more accurate answer than any of those individual observations. They then conducted a survey to determine an estimated answer.\nThe client was concerned that their respondees were insufficiently motivated and / or knowledgable within the study domain and requested a more involved supplementary analysis.\nMy analysis began with stating known variables (The specific characteristics of the subject child) and then a follow up desk based material review. From this review data sources for average child heights and weights was aquired along with average mass and body density data for various bird species.\nThe General Linear Models procedure (SAS Institute. Inc. 1988) was used to determine differences in density and feather mass among species and between sexes within species. Because the use of two or more related response variables (i.e. three measurements of density) to address a single hypothesis increases the probability of committing a type I error, the Bonferroni inequality technique was employed to ensure that the type I error rate was under .05 (Bed \u0026amp; Khamis 1991). To maintain this probability level, 0.05 was divided by the number of response variables (three) tested. resulting in significant differences at P \u0026lt; 0.017. If differences occurred. Tukey tests were used to determine which means differed.\nFrom these data sources I was able to determine the average volume of a five year old child to be 34 pigeons.\nThe final report was delivered to the client who reported a high level of satisfaction with the finished work.

Standard statistical analysis of sample data would show wild swings in their usage depending on if their output was sampled during the active period.\nIn order to correctly set pricing my team developed a tool to perform statistical analyses on water sampling data and use this to deduce the correct pricing level in terms of suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia content.\nThe client was interested in using an Excel front end, since they were familiar with excel, but to do most of the complicated statistical processing using R.

It would then descend underneath the main railway line into a cutting before entering a 5km tunnel. The tunnel would pass under Richings Park and Colnbrook and then merge with existing rail lines underground at Heathrow Terminal 5.\nThe proposed rail link would:\n Reduce rail journey times between Reading and Heathrow by delivering a new, faster, frequent, more reliable direct train service to Heathrow with four trains per hour in each direction. All trains would call at Reading and Slough and alternate trains at Twyford and Maidenhead. Journey times could be as short as 26 minutes from Reading and 6 to 7 minutes from Slough. Significantly improve rail connectivity to Heathrow from the Thames Valley, South Coast, South West, South Wales and West Midlands. Provide an alternative form of transport for passengers and the large number of people who work at the airport who are currently travelling by road. Ease congestion on roads, including the M4, M3 and M25 resulting in lower CO2 emissions equivalent to approximately 30 million road miles per year. Generate economic growth and new jobs across the Thames Valley and surrounding areas. Reduce passenger congestion at London Paddington.  As such there was a significant amount of analysis required to determine the value for money that such a route would provide. As lead data scientist for the project my role was to take large journey time and demand matrices for each proposed build case and either refactor them for GIS analysis or develop algorithms to determine the demand value across different passenger sectors.\nTraditionally this kind of demand modelling has been a slow process, using only a subset of available data. This is because the data inolved is far too big for traditional spreadsheet modelling. However replacing the spreadsheet component with algorithms developed in R allowed us to cycle through multiple business case model analyses across several years using the full datasets of each (in excess of 16 million data points per input type with 3 or 4 types per input set) using an automated method.
